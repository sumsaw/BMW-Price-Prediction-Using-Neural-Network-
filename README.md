# BMW-Price-Prediction-Using-Neural-Network-
This project fits a Neural Network on BMW price challenge dataset from Kaggle 

Ever Wondered what variables affect the price of pre-sued car . When I moved to Canada couple of years back I was looking to buy a pre-owned/pre-certified car. However, I used to the feel the prices quoted by the dealers to be very high for the car which I use to like. The prices which used to be quoted always use to beat my prediction by $2000â€“$3000 . Also since I am mechanical engineer who also happen to work in the automotive domain I always use to wonder what factors influence the price of a pre-certified car. With this data set on Kaggle, I got a chance to predict just that.I am sure many more people face the same question. I hope this data analysis and subsequent deep learning prediction model can help them.

__First lets describe the data-set variables__

__Maker key__: The brand of the car<br>
__Model key__: The model of the car<br>
__Mileage__: Total miles driven<br>
__Engine power__: Engine capacity<br>
__Registration date__: Date car was registered<br>
__Fuel:__ Type of fuel ( diesel, petrol,..)<br>
__Paint color:__ The color of the car car type- The type of car (sedan, SUV,)<br>
__Feature 1 to 8:__ Boolean features which the company wants to explore<br>
__Price:__ The price at which it was auctioned<br>
__Sold at__: The date at which it was sold at<br>

I explored the data with the help of matplotlib and seaborn the data visualization packages of python I was able to get some insights into the data set .

Finally I also fitted a Neural Network model on the dataset to predict price of the cars with similar features . I was able to explain about 82% variation in the dataset with R-squared value of 82%
